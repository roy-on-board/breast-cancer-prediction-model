# breast-cancer-prediction-model

The project aims to develop a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning techniques. It utilizes various algorithms to analyze data and predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

This project serves as a practical application of machine learning in healthcare, specifically targeting breast cancer detection, and demonstrates the use of various algorithms to improve diagnostic accuracy.


Key Components:
Data Source: The project likely uses datasets from medical databases, such as the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implements multiple algorithms, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, such as handling missing values and feature scaling.
Model Evaluation: The project evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
